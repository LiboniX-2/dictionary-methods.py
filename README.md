## Introduction

A Python dictionary is a mutable, unordered collection of items. Each item consists of a key-value pair, where keys are unique, and values can be of any data type. Python dictionaries are widely used to store data that is related to a specific key, and the ability to manage this data efficiently is crucial for any Python programmer.

This project provides an overview of the most commonly used dictionary methods in Python, with code examples and explanations.
